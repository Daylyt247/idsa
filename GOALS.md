### GOALS OF THE INTERNATIONAL DATA SPACES
Data sovereignty is a central aspect of the International Data Spaces. It can be defined as a natural person’s or corporate entity’s capability of being entirely self-determined with regard to its data. The International Data Spaces initiative proposes a Reference Architecture Model for this particular capability and related aspects, including requirements for secure and trusted data exchange in business ecosystems.

+ **TRUST:** Trust is the basis of the International Data Spaces. Each participant is evaluated and certified before being granted access to the trusted business ecosystem.

+ **SECURITY AND DATA SOVEREIGNTY:** All components of the International Data Spaces rely on state-of-the-art security measures. Apart from architectural specifications, security is mainly ensured by the evaluation and certification of each technical component used in the International Data Spaces. In line with the central aspect of ensuring data sovereignty, a data owner in the International Data Spaces attaches usage restriction information to their data before it is transferred to a data consumer. To use the data, the data consumer must fully accept the data owner’s usage policy.

+ **ECOSYSTEM OF DATA:** The architecture of the International Data Spaces does not require central data storage capabilities. Instead, it pursues the idea of decentralization of data storage, which means that data physically remains with the respective data owner until it is transferred to a trusted party. This approach requires a comprehensive description of each data source and the value and usability of data for other companies, combined with the ability to integrate domain-specific data vocabularies. In addition, brokers in the ecosystem provide services for real-time data search.

+ **STANDARDIZED INTEROPERABILITY:** The International Data Spaces Connector, being a central component of the architecture, is implemented in different variants and can be acquired from different vendors. Nevertheless, each Connector is able to communicate with any other Connector (or other technical component) in the ecosystem of the International Data Space.

+ **VALUE ADDING APPS:** The International Data Spaces allows to inject apps into the IDS Connectors in order to provide services on top of data exchange processes. This includes services for data processing, data format alignment, and data exchange protocols, for example. Furthermore, data analytics services can be provided by remote execution of algorithms.

+ **DATA MARKETS:** The International Data Space enables the creation of novel, data-driven services that make use of data apps. It also fosters new business models for these services by providing clearing mechanisms and billing functions, and by creating domain-specific broker solutions and marketplaces. In addition, the International Data Spaces provides templates and other methodological support for participants to use when specifying usage restriction information and requesting legal information.

All research and development activities, as well as all activities with regard to standardization, are driven by the following guidelines:

+ **OPEN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:** The International Data Spaces Association is a non-profit organization institutionalized under the German law of associations. Every organization is invited to participate, as long as it adheres to the common principles of work.

+ **RE-USE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES:** Inter-organizational information systems, data interoperability, and information security are well-established fields of research and development, with plenty of technologies available in the market. The work of the International Data Spaces initiative is guided by the idea not to “reinvent the wheel”, but to use existing technologies (e.g., from the open-source domain) and standards (e.g., semantic standards of the W3C) to the possible extent.

+ **CONTRIBUTION TO STANDARDIZATION:** Aiming at establishing an international standard itself, the International Data Spaces initiative supports the idea of standardized architecture stacks.
