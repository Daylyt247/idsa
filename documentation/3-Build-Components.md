# 3. Build Components
You can either build IDS components from scratch by using existing resources as a template, or you can reuse existing open source components available on the IDS Github repository. Already at this stage, you must ensure that the necessary requirements for a later, successful certification are met. Below you can check the existing projects that are available on IDS OS Landscape.

### Connectors

* [Dataspace Connector](../../../../DataspaceConnector/) 
* [Eclipse Dataspace Connector](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspaceconnector)
Existing open-source projects address the technical challenges of cataloguing and transferring data for a wide range of use cases. However, there is no open-source effort aimed at providing an interoperable, cross-organization framework for data sharing that is built on a common identity model and uniform policy enforcement. This project will integrate with existing data exchange technologies and provide these missing pieces to create a system for data sharing where each organization is able to exert control over how its shared data is used.
* [TRUE Connector](../../../../true-connector/) 
* [Trusted Connector](../../../../trusted-connector/) is an Apache Karaf-based platform for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).

### Metadata Broker

* [Metadata Broker Open Core](../../../../metadata-broker-open-core/)

### Identity Management

* [DAPS](../../../../omejdn-daps/) (Dynamic Attribute Provisioning Service) is the component to provide certain attributes to organizations and connectors. 
* [ParIS Open Core](../../../../ParIS-open-core/)
