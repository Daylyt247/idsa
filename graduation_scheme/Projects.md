Sandbox projects are “early stage,” this covers the following examples:

- New projects that are designed to extend one or more IDSA projects with functionality or interoperability libraries.
- Independent projects that fit the IDSA mission and provide the potential for a novel approach to existing functional areas (or are an attempt to meet an unfulfilled need).
- Projects commissioned or sanctioned by the IDSA, including initial code for IDSA WG collaborations, and “experimental” projects.
- Any project that realistically intends to join IDSA Incubation in future and wishes to lay the foundations for that.
