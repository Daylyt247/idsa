2. Name of project: Eclipse Dataspace Connector

3. Project Description:
Whatever the individual setup is — on-premises bare-metal, different cloud vendors, hybrid, even single end-user machines — the EDC can be customized to work within any environment at scale.   The connector’s added value is achieved through the separation of control and data plane, which enables a modular and thereby customizable way to build dataspaces. Due to common interfaces and mapping of existing standards, the connector adds capabilities of contract negotiating and policy handling in an interoperable manner.
As an open source project hosted by the Eclipse Foundation, it provides a growing list of modules for many widely-deployed cloud environments “out-of-the-box” and can easily be extended for more customized environments, while avoiding any intellectual property rights (IPR) headaches.

6. Roadmap of project:

- New organizations will be officially joining in the near future

- The EDC is continuing to evolve into a complete dataspace platform with Federated catalog and query support, Service registration and discovery, as well as support of centralized and federated identity services

- Cloud-to-cloud data transfer

- IDS support for Multipart messaging, contract offers (assets) with policy-based filtering, usage policy support, and initial contract negotiation support in Dec. 21

- Get IDS certification as soon as available re:licensing => The EDC is an official project of the Eclipse Foundation and will work in compliance to their rules and governance in terms of IP, CLA, etc.

7. Why do you want to have your project involved in IDS? What are the envisioned potential benefits for your project?:

Existing open-source projects address the technical challenges of cataloguing and transferring data for a wide range of use cases. However, there is no open-source effort aimed at providing an interoperable, cross-organization framework for data sharing that is built on a common identity model and uniform policy enforcement. This project will integrate with existing data exchange technologies and provide these missing pieces to create a system for data sharing where each organization is able to exert control over how its shared data is used. A data-sharing system requires a protocol implementation for policy enforcement among participants. The Eclipse Dataspace Connector will implement the International Data Spaces standard (IDS) as well as relevant protocols associated with the GAIA-X project. However, the connector will be extensible so that it can support alternative protocols. This project will provide implementation and use case feedback to IDS and GAIA-X.
