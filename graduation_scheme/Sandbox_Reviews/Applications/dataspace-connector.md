## Data Space Connector

Date of Application: 11.05.2022


1. Email: sebastian.kleff@sovity.de

2. Name of project: Data Space Connector

3. Description: With the help of the Dataspace Connector, existing software can easily be extended by IDS connector functionalities in order to integrate them into an IDS data ecosystem. Furthermore, it is possible to use the Dataspace Connector as a basis for the development of own software that is to be connected to an IDS data ecosystem.

6. Roadmap of project: The DSC will be enhanced from security and trust perspective going forward. The objective is to implement mechanisms for usage policy enforcement, adding user management as well as monitoring tools. The roadmap and features will continuously be revised and adjusted aligned with data space initiatives and market requirements.
The roadmap will be adjusted in Git: https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector/milestones

7. Why do you want to have your project involved in IDS? What are the envisioned potential benefits for your project?: The DataSpaceConnector (DSC) is a connector, that serves as reference implementation for IDS's Reference Architecture and is integrated as first Connector into IDSA Testbed. It allows an access to sovereign data sharing based on the IDS principles.
As part of the IDS graduation scheme, the DSC will remain very closely to the IDS architecture. We would like to engange further development teams within the DSC to contribute requirements and features.

9. Please explain how your project is aligned with and related to International Data Spaces?: The DSC is developed by following the IDS reference architecture and a connector that already supports the enforcement of eight usage condition classes of IDSA and thus exceeds the Base certification level. Following the requirements of the IDS, TLS-encrypted communication with other IDS connectors and, for example, communication with an IDS broker are supported in the context of an IDS data ecosystem.

10. Please list similar projects in the context of IDSA or elsewhere and explain the alignment or overlap: Some other connectors are seen as directly comparable like Trusted Connector of Fraunhofer AISEC, TRUE Connector of FIWARE or EclipseDataSpace Connector (EDC). DSC has been applied in many research projects and is proven in many research projects. It has the highest approved rate with 55 forks and 95 stars amonth all IDS Connectors
