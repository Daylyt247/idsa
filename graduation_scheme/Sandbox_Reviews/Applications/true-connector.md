2. Name of project: FIWARE TRUE Connector

3. Description: The FIWARE TRUE Connector enables the trusted data exchange in order to be an active part of an IDS Ecosystem, a virtual data space leveraging existing standards and technologies, as well as governance models well-accepted in the data economy, to facilitate secure and standardized data exchange and data linkage in a trusted business ecosystem. The integration of existing FIWARE ecosystems is guaranteed by the dedicated Data APP, enabling the IDS-based interaction in a plug-and-play way.
