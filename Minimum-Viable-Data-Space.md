# What is a Minimum Viable Data Space? 
A minimum viable data space (MVDS) is a combination of components to initiate a data space with just enough features to be usable for secure and sovereign data exchange. 
It aims to facilitate the work of experimenters by shortening the implementation time (by avoiding lengthy details that would slow down the first release). 
This allows them to start with a first working version (where secure and sovereign data exchange is granted), where the development team can iterate, identify and respond to the assumptions about the requirements of the data space. 

A Minimum Viable Data Space consists of the items that are available in Portfolio of IDS-compliant Building Blocks that are currently available 
on the [Build Components page](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/blob/main/how-to-build-data-spaces/3-Build-Components.md) of the 
[How to Build Data Spaces?](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/tree/main/how-to-build-data-spaces) section. 

MVDS is one of the IDS Deployment Scenarios provided by IDSA Head Office. 

(*The IDS Deployment Scenarios is currently under development and will be available by Q2, 2022*).
